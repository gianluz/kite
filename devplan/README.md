**Additional**: [Security Roadmap](security-roadmap.md) - Cross-phase security features

## Overall Progress

**MVP Status**: ✅ **Complete!** All core phases done  
**Production Code**: 7,200+ lines  
**Test Code**: 6,400+ lines  
**Documentation**: 8,500+ lines  
**Tests Passing**: 150+ tests ✅

## Current Roadmap (Post-MVP)

### 🔮 Next Up

- **Swift Script Support** (Exploratory) - Write segments in Swift
    - Danger-style inline dependency comments
    - Automatic Swift compilation and caching
    - Swift Package Manager integration
    - Estimated: 4-6 weeks

- **Plugin System** (Phase 8) - Extensibility framework
    - Plugin discovery and loading
    - API for custom segment types
    - Plugin marketplace
    - Estimated: 3-4 weeks

### 🌟 Future Enhancements

- Remote caching for distributed teams
- Distributed execution across multiple machines
- Web dashboard for visualization
- Additional language support (Python, Go, Rust)

## Terminology

- **Ride**: A workflow/pipeline composed of segments (formerly "pipeline")
- **Segment**: A unit of work in a ride (formerly "task")
- **Flow**: The execution order of segments within a ride
